* find.go : Generate clear error output for find func when value outside range
* more uniform error handling. Make a descision about what method to use.
  e.g. log.Fatal / errors.New
* stat.go : Mean() and Sigma() expects long double. Maybe we should Float128 for this.
* file.go : Output of String func too much detail
* testing : Faulty Increments (4 pcs). See output. This is a rounding error.
* 2d hist : Add complete 2d histogram functionality
* testing : Place all tests in 3 files: main_test.go, main1d_test.go and main2d_test.go

Done:
* file.go : Error checks on Read and Write methods
* init.go : I think func make_uniform can have a simpler calculation method.
