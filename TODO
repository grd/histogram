* all     : more uniform error handling. Make a descision about what method to 
            use. e.g. log.Fatal / errors.New
* testing : Faulty Increments (4 pcs). See output. This is a rounding error.
* testing : Place all tests in 3 files: main_test.go, main1d_test.go and 
            main2d_test.go
* file.go : Read and Write deal with buffer size. (also for file2d.go)
* all     : Is it sensible to create goroutines? And if yes, where?
* pdf.go  : All fields of struct are hidden. Do we need to access them?

Done:
* file.go : Error checks on Read and Write methods
* init.go : I think func make_uniform can have a simpler calculation method.
* file.go : Output of String func too much detail
* find.go : Generate clear error output for find func when value outside range
* stat.go : Mean() and Sigma() expects long double. Maybe Float128 ? 
            Answ: No. There will be a serious speed impact, a lot more code, 
            and finally, do you really want this accuracy from a histogram???
* 2d hist : Add complete 2d histogram functionality
