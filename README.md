# Histogram

***Work in progress !!!***

Pure [Go](http://www.golang.org) implementation of the [GSL Histogram library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Histograms.html).

For the API overview see [Godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/grd/histogram).

Testing is also work in progress. Testing covers (almost) the complete functionality.
Tested on Debian6 32-bit only.

See TODO for open issues.

Remarks and suggestions are welcome.
